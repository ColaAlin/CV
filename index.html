            <h3>Coding Bootcamps EU - Student</h3>
            <p>September 2022 - Present</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Everything started as a game with the <strong>MIMO</strong> app and
            after one year of daily exercise I said to my self
            <strong>"this is what I want to do"</strong>. I was very happy when
            my wife told me this words
            <strong
              ><em>"I'm pregnant, you are going to be a father"</em></strong
            >. I knew that I have to pause my dream and help her in every way I
            can. So after another year of playing the <strong>MIMO</strong> game
            and losing my job we finnaly decided it's time for me to go and
            follow my dream.

            <h3>Betriebsleiter - Car Wash Buxtehude GmbH</h3>
            <p>Mai 2020 - June 2022</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            It all started with visiting a friend of mine in
            <strong>Winsen Luhe</strong>, about 30 km from
            <strong>Hamburg</strong>. He was working for a car washing company,
            the salary was good and the tips even better. I decided to move from
            Austria in Germany. My job made me happy because I was spending
            every day seeing new cars <i>(I love cars)</i> and fixing things
            <i>(another hobby of mine)</i>. I had a great team and I thought
            this is the perfect job then I discovered Coding.
